# format-haiku
Code Formatter for Haiku's Coding Style Guidelines

This is a modification of [`clang-format`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to suit
the style guidelines<sup>[1]</sup> required by the [Haiku Project](https://www.haiku-os.org/), intended to help
reduce coding style violations from contributors.

There is currently no plan to upstream changes to `clang-format`.
